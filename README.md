# OECD Industrial Production Forecast Analysis
## Experiment Conducted for the University of SÃ£o Paulo Postgraduate Class EAD6034 - Time Series Econometrics (2023)
## Overview
This GitHub project is dedicated to the forecast analysis of the OECD Industrial Production using two distinct models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) based on the Box & Jenkins Methodology, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. The primary objective is to compare the performance of these models in forecasting industrial production and provide insights into their accuracy.

## Methodology
### ARIMA Model
The ARIMA model is built using the Box & Jenkins Methodology, which involves identifying the appropriate order of differencing, autoregressive, and moving average components. This time series analysis technique is a classic approach widely used for forecasting.

### MLP Neural Network
The MLP Neural Network is a machine learning model that leverages a multi-layered architecture to capture complex patterns in the data. The neural network is trained on historical OECD Industrial Production data to learn and predict future values.

## Results
After extensive analysis and evaluation, the results indicate that the MLP Neural Network outperformed the ARIMA model in terms of forecasting accuracy. However, it's noteworthy that both models exhibit the same statistical accuracy, according to the Diebold-Mariano test.
